## HANGMAN GAME WEB



Hangman-web consists in creating and running a server, in which it will be possible to use a web GUI (graphical user interface) version of our last project, hangman-classic. We had to use a go module to call our functions from hangman-classic.

We needed to create a private repository with the name hangman-web



## For begin !



- The server.go file interacts with the server! So that's the essence of the backend!

- The web page is formed from content, index and layout files!

- Don't forget to import the files error_404 and error_501 to improve the user experience!

- And of course the pos_hangman folder that allows the user to view the hanged man!



## Execute the program



Execute the command : go run .

And then, lauch the page http://localhost:3000/ on the web
